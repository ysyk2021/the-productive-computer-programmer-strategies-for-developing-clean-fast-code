Computer programming has become an essential part of our daily lives, from the websites we visit to the apps we use on our smartphones. With the increasing demand for software development, the need for efficient and productive programmers has never been greater.

Productivity is crucial in computer programming for several reasons. Firstly, it determines how quickly a programmer can complete a task. In today's fast-paced world, time is money, and the ability to deliver high-quality code within a shorter timeframe is a significant advantage for both the programmer and the company.
