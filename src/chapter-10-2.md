* Always strive for continuous improvement. Technology is constantly evolving, and there is always something new to learn. Keep up with the latest trends and best practices in programming, and seek out new challenges and opportunities for growth.

* Prioritize readability and maintainability in your code. Clean code is not only easier to read and understand, but it is also more efficient and easier to maintain. Take the time to organize your code properly and document it thoroughly for future reference.

* Collaborate with others. Programming is often a team effort, and working collaboratively with other programmers, project managers, and stakeholders can lead to better outcomes. Share your knowledge and expertise, and be open to learning from others.

* Practice self-care. Burnout is a real risk in the tech industry, given the high demands and fast-paced nature of the work. Take care of your physical and mental health by taking breaks when needed, getting regular exercise, and engaging in activities that bring you joy outside of work.

In conclusion, developing clean, fast code and improving productivity as a computer programmer requires a combination of technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and personal development. By mastering the strategies and techniques outlined in this book and prioritizing ongoing learning and growth, you can become a productive and successful computer programmer.
